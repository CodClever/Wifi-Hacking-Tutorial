WiFi hacking is very much still a thing performed by both white hat and black hat hackers. In this video, NetworkChuck will demonstrate how hackers might hack a wifi network from three different levels or perspectives, a Noob, Hipster and Pro. All of the wireless attacks demonstrated in this video are real and possible. The purpose of this video is NOT to equip an army of skiddies but to educate people on how WiFi hacks occur and what they can do to protect themselves and the networks they run. In this video, NetworkChuck will demonstrate man-in-the-middle attacks, evil twin attacks, arp spoofing, dns spoofing and wifi password cracking.
